# Data Science Code Challenge

This repository includes a [dataset](data/chat_demand.csv) that represents the demand in chats (number of daily active users on the platform) at Dialogue and the number of users that have access to the platform (paid_employees). The team wants to forecast the demand to make sure that the virtual clinic is always staffed properly. A good solution minimizes costs while keeping a good quality of service.

Based on this data, create a forecast of the number of chats for the month of July.

Please include the code used to generate the forecast and an explanation of why you chose this method, including visualizations and/or summary statistics.

1. Include an exploratory data analysis and report any finding on the dataset
2. Provide a recommendation on the number of nurses needed per day in July
3. How would you evaluate the accuracy of your model?
4. If the team starts using this model to staff the clinic, how would you evaluate the impact of this change?
5. What are the next steps to improve the modelâ€™s accuracy and its impact on costs and quality of service?

# Notes

- The code challenge can be completed in either Python or R
- You can use any library you believe is relevant to the completion of the tasks
- Beyond the accuracy of the models, we will pay close attention to the exploratory analysis completed and the explanation of methology used
